    <p class="p_large">“People are in prison to be punished, not to read or get handouts”, “There are a lot of people who are more deserving”, and “Let’s give books to kids first” are just some of the comments we often recieve. We understand why people may have these reservations. Many dedicated BTB volunteers in fact thought the same when they first started. So… why do we do this work?</p>

    <div class="contain-width">
        <p>Each year hundreds of thousands of individuals return to the streets with the same problems that landed them in prison in the first place.</p>
        <p>Nearly 75% of state prison inmates did not complete high school. 65% are dealing with substance abuse or addictions. Instead of helping them in their road to recovery, years behind bars deprives them of formal education and job experience.</p>
        <p class="pull_quote">The answers to these problems is not imprisonment. It is knowledge.</p>
        <p>Studies overwhelmingly show that prisoners who become more educated while incarcerated are less likely to return to prison. The free books and correspondence courses provided by Books Through Bars directly address the gap in resources and access to education.</p>

        <h2>&ldquo;Why should I care?&rdquo;</h2>
        <p>Since 1980, the number of Americans in jail has quintupled, from a little under 500,000 to, in 2011, over 2.2 million. As multiple studies show, putting all these people behind bars has not deterred crime or kept us safer. In fact, it has:</p>
        <ul class="pretty-list-body">
            <li>Pulled people out of schools and careers, derailing their future prospects.</li>
            <li>Decimated communities — in particular, poor communities of color.</li>
            <li>Locked individuals, families and whole communities into relentless cycles of poverty.</li>
            <li>Drained federal, state and local budgets, resulting in states slashing education spending while increasing prison spending.</li>
            <li>Led to prison overcrowding, poor conditions, stretched budgets, and fewer libraries and educational opportunities for people in prison.</li>

        <p>We know our work makes a direct difference to prisoners: hundreds have told us so. At their lowest point, they were given access to knowledge that taught them something new and gave them the power and confidence to change for the better. What they learn — literacy, skills, self-confidence, self-help — changes their lives and the lives of those around them, both behind and outside of bars.</p>
