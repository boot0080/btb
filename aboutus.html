    <h2>A bit of history</h2>
    <p class="decor-subtitle">thousands of people united in one mission</p>
    <div class="contain-width">
        <p>Todd was an employee at a small press located in Philadelphia called New Society Publishers. He was given a letter that a prisoner had sent, asking for free copies of overstock or damaged books. He responded to that letter with a few books and shortly after, more requests came in.</p>
        <p>After he began to get dozens of requests a week, Todd got some friends and coworkers to help, and advertised the program in some publications for prisoners. Word spread, donated books began to come in, and the group secured a collective meeting place and community center in West Philadelphia. From there, the project grew into thousands.</p>
        <p>Over two decades later, Books Through Bars is thousands of people united in one mission which is accomplished through the hard work and dedication of our volunteers and donors.</p>
        <p>Incarcerated people who ask for books. Volunteers who help letters, choose books, send out packages. People who donate the books, materials and the funding to make it all happen. We are organized as a collective with core group members make decisions about the organization.</p>

        <h3 class="hovercolor">Programs and activities</h3>
        <p>For the past 20 years, we've been developing programs that address the social, educational, and economic inequalities that result in relentless cycles of poverty and crime; touching upon factors like the poor access to quality educational programming and materials, lack of public knowledge about of the factors that lead to imprisonment, the real cost to society, and alternatives to imprisonment.
Our goal is to directly and positively impact all who participate.</p>

                        <p><span class="italic">Address This!</span> is an education and empowerment project. It provides innovative correspondence courses to individuals incarcerated in Pennsylvania, with a special focus on the participation of prisoners in solitary confinement or maximum security, who often have little access to educational options.</p>
                        <p>Each course is intended to foster dialogue, promote collective critical thinking and reading skills, raise awareness, encourage self-empowerment, and provide an outlet for stimulating discussion on issues of importance to all of our lives. Over the course of six months, participants receive monthly reading packets and related discussion questions to that they provide responses to. Classes currently offered include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Black Social Movements from Civil Rights to Hip Hop</li>

                        <p>The classes were developed with the help of community organizations, activists, and scholars with expertise in the respective area.

                    <h3>Book Packages</h3>
                    <p>BTB’s original and longest-running program. In short: prisoners ask us for books, and we send them. BTB’s core program distributes books and educational materials to individual prisoners in the Mid-Atlantic region, prison libraries across the country, and halfway houses throughout the greater Philadelphia area.</p>
                    <div class="see-more-2" data-state="collapsed">
                        <h4>Individual Book Packages</h4>
                        <p>We provide small packages of books to individual prisoners in the Mid-Atlantic region: Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, New York, Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia. The books are free, and we send them to anyone who asks, providing they are in the region we serve and the prison accepts books.</p>
                        <p>Would you like us to send books to your friend or family member in prison? Please <a href="#" class="linkreset">view the guidelines</a> and <a class="linkreset" href="#contact">get in touch</a> to request books for your incarcerated loved one.</p>
                        <h4>Prison libraries, education programs and halfway houses</h4>
                        <p>We welcome requests for larger boxes of books from libraries or prison education programs in any state (although we prioritize requests from our region). We will also deliver donations of books directly to prisons, jails and halfway houses in the Greater Philadelphia area. We are particularly interested in supporting libraries in the Mid-Atlantic region. Wherever possible, we try to assemble donations in accordance with a particular facility’s needs, and work to ensure that our donations complement, as well as supplement, educational programming. Please <a href="#" class="linkreset">view the guidelines</a> and <a class="linkreset" href="#contact">get in touch</a> to request books.</p>

                    <p>Educating the public at large is critical to contributing towards broader societal change. BTB conducts service learning workshops for groups and participates panels and public events addressing incarceration.</p>
                    <div class="see-more-3" data-state="collapsed">

                        <p>In addition to providing books and educational materials to incarcerated people who do not have access to them, Books Through Bars also strives to educate the general public about prison issues. Our public outreach has included:</p>
                        <p>Service learning: This is a current staple of our public outreach. We’ve developed several curricula for various groups (youth, interfaith, community) to educate on issues such as mass incarceration, solitary confinement, the role of race and class in criminal justice, and the effect of incarceration on families. We welcome groups who are interested in volunteering their time and learning more about these issues.</p>
                        <p>Sitting on panels and staffing tables at community events to raise awareness around prison issues. Examples include staffing a table at a screening of the documentary “The House I Live In” at the Enon Tabernackle Baptist Church and being present at the Painted Bride’s Art and Incarceration event.</p>
                        <p>Hosting numerous events to raise awareness about prison issues, including a film festival, read-a-thons, a public conversation on alternatives to prisons, and a display of quilts made by prisoner-volunteers in Angola’s hospice program.</p>
                        <p>Coordinating art exhibitions of “Contexts,” a collection of artwork by prisoners, across the tri-state area.</p>
                        <p>Publishing a yearly newsletter that highlights BTB’s activities and volunteers and includes articles about current state and national prison issues.</p>
