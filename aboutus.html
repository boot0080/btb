    <!-- VOLUNTEERING -->
    
    <p class="p_large">Located Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Books Through Bars all-volunteer non-profit organization that distributes free and educational materials to incarcerated people.</p>
    <p class="p_large">We believe systemic social, educational, and economic inequality leads to relentless cycles of crime and mass incarceration. Our work aims to reverse the devastating effects that injustice and incarceration has on individuals, families, and communities.</p>
    
    <h2>A bit of history</h2>
    <p>Todd was an employee at a small press located in Philadelphia called New Society Publishers. He was given a letter that a prisoner had sent, asking for free copies of overstock or damaged books. He responded to that letter with a few books and shortly after, more requests came in.</p>
    <p>After he began to get dozens of requests a week, Todd got some friends and coworkers to help, and advertised the program in some publications for prisoners. Word spread, donated books began to come in, and the group secured a collective meeting place and community center in West Philadelphia. From there, the project grew into thousands.</p>
    <p>Over two decades later, Books Through Bars is thousands of people united in one mission which is accomplished through the hard work and dedication of our volunteers and donors.</p>
    <p>Incarcerated people who ask for books. Volunteers who help letters, choose books, send out packages. People who donate the books, materials and the funding to make it all happen. We are organized as a collective with core group members make decisions about the organization.</p>

                    <h3>Program One</h3>
                    <p>The easiest way to get involved with Books Through Bars is to participate in one of our regularly scheduled book packing activities. You will read letters from prisoners requesting books, search through our library of donated books for a good match, and package the books for mailing.</p>

                    <h3>Program Two</h3>
                    <p>We receive hundreds of book request letters each week. Each one needs to be read, sorted and logged into our database.
With some training required, letter loggers can easily do this task from home—all you need is a computer and internet connection. Trips to our office is needed to pick up and drop off letters. </p>
