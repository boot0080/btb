    <h2>A bit of history</h2>
    <p class="decor-subtitle">thousands of people united in one mission</p>
    <div class="contain-width">
        <p>Todd was an employee at a small press located in Philadelphia called New Society Publishers. He was given a letter that a prisoner had sent, asking for free copies of overstock or damaged books. He responded to that letter with a few books and shortly after, more requests came in.</p>
        <p>After he began to get dozens of requests a week, Todd got some friends and coworkers to help, and advertised the program in some publications for prisoners. Word spread, donated books began to come in, and the group secured a collective meeting place and community center in West Philadelphia. From there, the project grew into thousands.</p>
        <p>Over two decades later, Books Through Bars is thousands of people united in one mission which is accomplished through the hard work and dedication of our volunteers and donors.</p>
        <p>Incarcerated people who ask for books. Volunteers who help letters, choose books, send out packages. People who donate the books, materials and the funding to make it all happen. We are organized as a collective with core group members make decisions about the organization.</p>

        <h3 class="hovercolor">Programs and activities</h3>
        <p>For the past 20 years, we've been developing programs that address the social, educational, and economic inequalities that result in relentless cycles of poverty and crime; touching upon factors like the poor access to quality educational programming and materials, lack of public knowledge about of the factors that lead to imprisonment, the real cost to society, and alternatives to imprisonment.
Our goal is to directly and positively impact all who participate.</p>
