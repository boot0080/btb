    <h1>Help Out</h1>
    <p class="p_large">Books Through Bars is an all-volunteer organization. Our volunteers range from students to retirees, hail from all parts of Philadelphia, its suburbs and even other states, and come from every walk of life. We’re a lively and eclectic group united for a single worthy cause.</p>

    <h2>Weekly Volunteer Hours</h2>
    <p>Join us on Tuesday nights 7:30–9:30 PM or the 1st and 3rd Saturday of every month, 11:00 AM–2:00 PM.</p>
    <p>Our walk-in sessions are 18 and over only. Contact us to arrange service learning events for kids and young adults. We welcome groups, but ask that you contact us ahead of time so we can accommodate you</p>

    <h2>Volunteering for groups</h2>
    <p>BTB hosts a variety of groups, from schools and universities to interfaith groups, community service organizations and even birthday parties. We welcome groups of up to 15 or so people. For groups with youth, we require a chaperone for every five kids.</p>
    <p>For special service groups, a BTB volunteer will also give a short presentation and lead a discussion about incarceration and educational systems, and how BTB works to intervene in those cycles.</p>
