                    <p>The easiest way to get involved with Books Through Bars is to participate in one of our regularly scheduled book packing activities. You will read letters from prisoners requesting books, search through our library of donated books for a good match, and package the books for mailing.</p>

                    <p>We receive hundreds of book request letters each week. Each one needs to be read, sorted and logged into our database.
With some training required, letter loggers can easily do this task from home—all you need is a computer and internet connection. Trips to our office is needed to pick up and drop off letters. </p>
