                    <h3>Book Picking and Packing</h3>
                    <p>The easiest way to get involved with Books Through Bars is to participate in one of our regularly scheduled book packing activities. You will read letters from prisoners requesting books, search through our library of donated books for a good match, and package the books for mailing.</p>

    <h2>Weekly Volunteer Hours</h2>
    <p>Join us on Tuesday nights 7:30–9:30 PM or the 1st and 3rd Saturday of every month, 11:00 AM–2:00 PM.</p>
    <p>Our walk-in sessions are 18 and over only. Contact us to arrange service learning events for kids and young adults. We welcome groups, but ask that you contact us ahead of time so we can accommodate you</p>

    <h2>Volunteering for groups</h2>
    <p>BTB hosts a variety of groups, from schools and universities to interfaith groups, community service organizations and even birthday parties. We welcome groups of up to 15 or so people. For groups with youth, we require a chaperone for every five kids.</p>
    <p>For special service groups, a BTB volunteer will also give a short presentation and lead a discussion about incarceration and educational systems, and how BTB works to intervene in those cycles.</p>
